Controls:
Use w,a,s,d to move.
Use space to shoot a glaive. You must be pressing a direction to shoot.

Additional Infor:
You only have glaives. You can pick up any any glaive once it has stopped moving.
Glaives bounce of off walls and kill enemies.
Kill all enemies to win.
Get touched by an enemy or a spiked wall and you lose.

Collision response is based of ellastic collisions. although it is a little buggy and I have not implemented the full system.
